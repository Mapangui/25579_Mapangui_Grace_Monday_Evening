# 25579_Mapangui_Grace_Monday_Evening

Summary:
This submission demonstrates the handling of both checked and unchecked exceptions in Java. Each example is designed to deliberately trigger a specific exception in a meaningful scenario and then handle it using try-catch blocks. Appropriate error messages are displayed to help identify the exception, and comments are included to clarify the purpose of each code block.

Approach:
1. Checked Exceptions: Simulate scenarios like file operations, database connectivity, and class loading errors.
2. Unchecked Exceptions: Handle runtime issues such as null references, division by zero, and invalid type casting.
3. Each example is concise, focused on the exception, and includes a catch block to demonstrate error handling effectively.
